# Project Rules

## Environment
- All commands must be formatted for Windows
- IDE: VS Code

## Workflow
- Document all discussions and plans in plan1.md
- Number each change for easy reference
- For each change, create a prompt file in /prompts folder BEFORE starting work:
  - Format: change-XX-description.md
  - Include: prompt, files created, commands to recreate, verification steps
- This keeps implementation clean and debugging simple
- Prompt files allow re-running specific changes in isolation if needed

## Code Quality
- Never keep legacy/dead code in scripts - remove it completely
- Keep code clean and tidy at all times
- Maintain a CHANGELOG.md for each project
- Never use "patch on patch" - fix things properly the first time
